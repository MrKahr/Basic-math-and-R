# Basic-math-and-R
I'm a linguistic trying to learn basic math and statistics using R. 
This repository is mainly for helping me learn, but the code should be reasonably commented, so if you find anything interesting (or have a comment about my coding) feel free to write me, I'd love to learn more!

All code is written in R.
